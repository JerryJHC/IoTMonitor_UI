# IoTMonitor

Internet of Things (IoT) brings us to the concept of remote communication of sensors that monitor real-world objects through the Internet. This IoT project focuses on monitoring the temperature, pressure and humidity of a place using the Raspberry Pi and its SenseHat add-on with its set of sensors.

It is based on the Serveless architecture applied through the Firebase services that provides data store, cloud computing and web hosting for an application developed to graphically display and analyze the results received by the device. This offers the capability to measure an environment and be able to prevent or correct the conditions.
